# NOTES
* If you need anyone to follow any specific conventions, add them here.
* If you have any specific todo for anyone, add it under your name with the name of the person.
* For future references, for uncompleted features, leave a commented TODO with description in the code.

- Include comments before function describing arguments and returns value.
### BackEnd
